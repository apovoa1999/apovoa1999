### Projects: 
I designed and implemented a **fully normalized PostgreSQL database** to manage metadata for the MoMA collection. This project demonstrates my ability to build and manage a relational database from the ground up.

**Latest Project:** MoMA Art Metadata Service (https://github.com/apovoa1999/MOMA-Art-Metadata-SQL-Project)
* **Goal:** Apply academic concepts of schema design (3NF) and database management to a real-world dataset.
* **Key Skills Applied:** Multi-table **JOINs** (4-way), **Data Aggregation** (`GROUP BY`), and **Database Design (DDL/DML)**.
